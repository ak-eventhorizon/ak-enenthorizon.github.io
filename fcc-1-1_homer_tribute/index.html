				<h2>1950s</h2>
				<p>Homer Jay Simpson was born as the third child of Abraham Simpson, and the first (and only) child of Mona Simpson on May 12, 1956. He was raised on the Simpson farm by his parents until they were forced to move out due to Homer spooking the cows by jumping out of a bale of hay and scaring them into giving sour milk. At some point during his childhood, Abe seemed to feed beer to Homer, but he quit drinking beer until he was older upon Barney's suggestion after he caused a multi-car pileup in his playschool car at school.</p>
				<q>Mmm... donuts...</q>

				<h2>1960s</h2>
				<p>In 1960, Homer experimented to see if he can push fifteen crayons into his nose, which resulted in one being lodged into his brain and being responsible for his current below-average intelligence. In the early 1960s, when Homer was between nine and twelve years of age, Mona went into hiding following a run-in with the law. However, before she started protesting, she took Homer and her husband to the Woodstock Music Festival, where Homer ended up briefly adopting the hippie lifestyle (and Abe Simpson attempted to send him off to the Vietnam War as punishment for wanting to be a hippie).</p>
				<p> In 1966, Homer, along with Lenny, Carl, and Moe, went over to a deep gorge for a nice swim, but the water was drained. When investigating why the lake was reduced to a muddy pit, he stumbled upon a decomposing corpse inside the pipe, greatly traumatizing him and leading to his occasional overeating and fear of corpses.</p>
				<q>Better them than me... Oh wait, that was me.</q>

				<h2>1970s</h2>
				<p>Homer attended Springfield High School and fell in love with Marge Bouvier in 1974. After high school, Homer and Marge bought an apartment at Springfield Place. During this time, Marge received a letter accepting her into college. To pay for her tuition, Abe gave him a job at Simpson Lazer Tag. Along with Lou, Lenny, and Carl, Homer was also part of a barbershop quartet. When Marge became infatuated with her professor, Homer changed the band's name to Sadgasm, and they invented grunge music. Marge realized she really loves Homer, and she went back to him.</p>
				<p>In 1979, Marge became pregnant with Bart. (After discovering this, Homer tore out half his hair.) At this time, Homer was working at Sir Putts-A-Lot, turning the crank spinning the windmill. The two married in Shotgun Pete's 24 Hour Wedding Chapel, a small wedding chapel across the state line. They spent their wedding reception alone at a truck stop, before ending up at the Bouvier House, where they lived at the time. </p>
				<p>After failing to get a job at the newly built Nuclear Power Plant, Homer left Marge to find a job where he can support his family. He went to work at a taco restaurant called the Gulp 'n' Blow, until Marge found him and convinced him to return home with her. As a result, Homer confronted Mr. Burns and secured a job at the Plant.</p>
				<q>Why you little...!</q>

				<h2>1980s</h2>
				<p>Two years after Bart was born, Marge became pregnant with Lisa in 1981 (after discovering this, Homer tore out all but three strands of his hair), shortly before the couple brought their first house. Homer's second leap to stardom was his success as the lead singer and songwriter for the barbershop quartet, the Be-Sharps, even winning a Grammy Award. (He later complains a Grammy isn't worth winning.) During his time with the group, Homer was frequently absent from home, which put stress on his marriage. After the group broke up due to creative differences, Homer went back to Springfield to continue his old life.</p>
				<p>Some time in the late 1980s, Homer drew up a budget so he can work at his dream job, a pin monkey at Barney's Bowlarama. The budget included buying regular toilet paper and only one of the kids can go to college. Unfortunately for Homer, Marge became pregnant with Maggie in 1988, shortly after he started his new job, and, not being able to support his family, he went back to the Nuclear Plant.</p>
				<p>Since then Homer started many jobs, including being a professional astronaut for NASA, but ended up back where he began at the Nuclear Plant. He nearly caused the destruction of Springfield a couple of times, after a nuclear meltdown at the plant and polluting Lake Springfield with his petpig's (and his own) waste.</p>
				<q>Stupid Flanders!</q>

				<h2>Appearance</h2>
				<p>Homer's appearance is that of an overweight balding man. Despite his overweight status, and hate for exercise, he has on occasion shown surprising physical prowess and agility for a man of his body type, such as when training for Whacking Day and he hits several pop-up Snakes with kicks and even back-flipping. His baldness is contributed by several factors, such as upon finding out whenever Marge was pregnant, he would tear out a substantial amount of his hair. Another contribution is working at the nuclear plant for so many years that the exposure to radioactivity has caused most of his hair to fall out.</p>
				<p>Another frequent topic on Homer's obesity is his large posterior which is often joked about by Bart. His eyes are blue and he is 6 feet tall (183 cm). While his weight is debatable, the most common weight given is 239 pounds (though many jokes about his weight would suggest he is much heavier). He wears a white polo shirt, blue jeans, white underpants, and gray loafers.</p>
				<q>I am evil Ho-mer! I am evil Ho-mer!</q>

				<h2>Religious</h2>
				<p>Despite attending church every Sunday, Homer is not very religious, and it is likely that he only attends church because he knows that Marge would be hurt and shocked if he did not. He does not seem to practice Christian morals and frequently sleeps in church, much to the annoyance of Reverend Lovejoy. He also admitted that in addition to sleeping in church, he also mentally undresses the female churchgoers. He often mispronounces the name of the Christ, calling Him "Jebus".</p>
				<p>He actually met God face to face several times and even got permission from him in a dream to skip church. (God is a lot less uptight than Marge or Rev. Lovejoy.)</p>
				<q>Dear God, give a bald guy a break. Amen.</q>

				<h2>Awards</h2>
				<p>The C. Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence (after Burns found out Homer was sterile due to radiation exposure).</p>
				<p>Employee of the Month at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant (after saving the plant from meltdown).</p>
				<p>Grammy Award for "Outstanding Soul, Spoken Word or Barbershop Album of the Year" for his work with the Be Sharps.</p>
				<p>High School reunion trophies for most weight gained, most hair lost, most improved odor, and person who travelled least distance.</p>
				<q>Woo-hoo!</q>

				<h2>Personality</h2>
				<p>The comic efficacy of Homer's personality lies in his frequent bouts of bumbling stupidity, laziness and his explosive anger that leads to cowardice. He has a low intelligence level and is described by director David Silverman as "creatively brilliant in his stupidity". Homer also shows immense apathy towards work, is overweight, and "is devoted to his stomach". His short attention span is evidenced by his impulsive decisions to engage in various hobbies and enterprises, only to "change ... his mind when things go badly".</p>
				<p>Homer often spends his evenings drinking Duff Beer at Moe's Tavern, and was shown in the episode "Duffless" as a full-blown alcoholic. He is very envious of his neighbors, Ned Flanders and his family, and is easily enraged by Bart. Homer will often strangle Bart on impulse upon Bart angering him (and can also be seen saying one of his catchphrases, "Why you little!") in a cartoonish manner.</p>
				<p>If we keep it that he's ruled by his impulses, then he can easily switch impulses. So, even though he impulsively wants to strangle Bart, he also gives up fairly easily." Another of the original ideas entertained by Groening was that Homer would "always get his comeuppance or Bart had to strangle him back", but this was dropped. Homer shows no compunction about expressing his rage, and does not attempt to hide his actions from people outside the family.</p>
				<q>D'oh!</q>

				<h2>Creation</h2>
				<p>Naming the characters after members of his own family, Groening named Homer after his father Homer Groening, who himself had been named after ancient Greek poet Homer. Very little else of Homer's character was based on him, and to prove that the meaning behind Homer's name was not significant, Groening later named his own son Homer.</p>
				<p>According to Groening, "Homer originated with my goal to both amuse my real father, and just annoy him a little bit. My father was an athletic, creative, intelligent filmmaker and writer, and the only thing he had in common with Homer was a love of donuts." Although Groening has stated in several interviews that Homer was named after his father, he also claimed in several 1990 interviews that a character in the 1939 Nathanael West novel The Day of the Locust was the inspiration for naming Homer.</p>
				<p>Homer's middle initial "J", which stands for "Jay", is a "tribute" to animated characters such as Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, who got their middle initial from Jay Ward.</p>
				<p>Homer made his debut with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night". In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series airing on the Fox Broadcasting Company. Homer and the Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show.</p>
				<q>Whatever, I'll be at Moe's.</q>
